Because of the global pandemic of Covid-19, wearing a face mask in public is becoming increasingly popular. Since the people of Covid-19 refuse secure their health by wearing masks against air pollution broader public by moving their own faces. Putting face masks helps to prevent Covid-19 transmission
Because of the expansion of the corona virus sickness, it has gotten a lot of attention lately since numerous countries have adopted policies such as ”No admission without a mask.” Face mask detection is a critical issue in security and the prevention of Covid-19
In the medical industry, a mask minimizes the danger of infection from an infected individual, whether or not they show symptoms. Face mask detection is employed in a variety of settings, including airports, hospitals, offices, and educational institutions. Face recognition with no a mask is simpler, but faces recognition with just a mask is more difficult since masked face feature extraction is more difficult than conventional face feature extraction. Many facial characteristics, such as the nose, lips, and chin, are missing from the covered face. 

**To Run The Project:**
You need to first install python Libraries onto your computer:

1) Numpy & Pandas
2) Tensorflow
3) keras( It usually get installed with Tensorflow but if you have any problem try installing keras as whole)
4) OpenCV

After Installing and running the project this will be the final output:
